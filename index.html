        is death, caused by drowning, water-borne diseases, diarrhea,
        snakebites, and in Nepal landslides and also by structural damages

      “We have never seen this sort of flooding in our living memories in that
      <br />
      region. Hundreds of thousands of people took refuge as their houses went
      <br />
      under water and almost all their neighborhoods inundated. Large parts of
      <br />
      Sunamganj and Sylhet were completely cut off due to severe disruption of
      <br />
      road communication and power cuts. “Our volunteer teams were on the ground
      <br />
      helping people with much needed dry foods, cooked food, safe drinking
      <br />
      water. Bangladesh Red Crescent has launched a strategy involving USD 10
      <br />
      million to carry out relief and recovery operations in the affected <br />
      areas.”

            The non-governmental organisation BRAC has been working alongside
            local government since the beginning of the recent flood situation
            in the country. The organisation has allocated BDT 3 crore from its
            own funds for emergency flood relief. The money will be used to
            provide dry food, safe drinking water, oral saline, matches,
            candles, essential medicines and other services to people affected
            by flood. The money will also be used to rescue people trapped in
            the flood. Initially, the relief will provide support to around
            52,000 families.

            The surge in flood waters have inundated 21 districts in Bangladesh
            particularly in the north affecting over 2 million people. Usually
            the difficulty of floods is duration. i.e. the consequent scarcity
            of food / supplies; or unpredictability of time which leads to
            agricultural losses. This time it's the sheer magnitude. Friendship
            is providing rescue, shelter, water, sanitation and emergency
            medical support from the relief contingency budget and we urgently
            need to replenish the same to continue

            10 years ago, food was the first need. Today with interventions from
            various organisations where Friendship played a large role
            especially in the riverine islands, people have learned to save
            money and dry food stocks through our community savings model.
            Friendship is providing support from the relief contingency budget
            and we urgently need supplies of medicine, water, sanitation,
            volunteer support etc. to continue. If the flood lasts, food and
            rehabilitation support will surely be needed.

          While talking to the flood victims at the centre, this correspondent
          was informed that the local councillor visited on June 16. But the
          flood victims said they did not receive any government assistance yet.
          However, many locals have given them cooked or dry food a few times.
          Md Mostu Mia, an elderly person from Chhararpar area of ​​the city,
          has taken shelter there with his family of 13 including his
          grandchildren.
